# This file controls Flutter-level build settings. Potential values are "normal",
# or "watcher", to map the watcher assistant to the build modes.
#
# For more information, see:
# https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Experimental-Feature-Work-in progress
# This feature is experimental and has been implemented with significant
# limitations. For now, it remains experimental until the Flutter team can
# complete the implementation.
#
# If this is disabled, the watcher will not be started.

# The name of the builder.

# This value is used to identify the builder in the Flutter tool.
# For example, `flutter build web --builder=my_builder`.

# The path to the builder's main entry point, relative to the `--source` path.
#
# If the builder is a package from pub.dev, use `package:<package_name>:<entrypoint>`.

#
# If not specified, the default entry point for a builder is `lib/main.dart`.
